# Java Native SDK common errors {#concept_gz3_f3c_p2b .concept}

Common exceptions:

-   Exception: Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: fail to get diamond-server serverlist! env:default
-   Cause: During the public beta, the ACM Java Native SDK or Spring Cloud ACM applications must be deployed in an Alibaba Cloud classic network or a VPC network to access the ACM configuration. This is out of security and QoS considerations. The access point for public networks may be available later.
